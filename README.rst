Annotation: Python annotation library
=====================================

This library aims to provides tools to do annotation in a reflective language.

What does mean annotations in a reflective way:

- annotations may have to be modifiable at runtime

    + potentially one annotation for several elements
    + annotations may annotate any type of element (from class to class instances and annotations)
    + such as a reflective object, they could have their own behavior
